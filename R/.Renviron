# R Environment Variables
# Loaded before R starts (including --slave mode)
# This ensures R.nvim can find the user library for nvimcom installation

# Use R's default user library structure with platform prefix
# %p = platform (e.g., x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, aarch64-apple-darwin)
# %v = major.minor version (e.g., 4.5)
# This matches R's default and works cross-platform (macOS, Linux)
